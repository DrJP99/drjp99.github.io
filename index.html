				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>
					 I am JP Dixon, I'm an author currently working on my book series: A Dream of Kings. An epic fantasy about about a boy who must travel across dimensions and must discover his place in the world before facing his greatest enemy. <i>Fear</i>.

					 I have always been a fan of fantasy and science fiction, and it has been my mission in life to be able to make other people laugh and feel happy by telling stories. I hope my works can make you feel something. Some of my favorite movies and books include The Lord of the Rings, Mistborn, the Wheel of Time (although I have not fiished it yet), A Song of Ice and Fire, Star Wars, Dune and Harry Potter.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also a great lover of music, I have played guitar ever since I was sixteen and I've always loved playing and jamming with my friends. My favorite bands and artists include The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink Floyd, Steely Dan and Supertramp. You can listen to some of my covers on my YouTube and Instagram pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					 I like to learn languages since this helps me with my writting, as well as just helping me connect with other people across the globe. Learning about different cultures and languages helps me with the worldbuilding of my worlds, which is one of my favorite aspects of writting. I hope you're excited to learn about Vrotonia, Vorboros-Naz, Ficcius, Old Durum and a hidden part of San Francisco as I am to write about it.
