						Hello! Nice to meet you! I guess you somehow stumbled onto my website somehow. Well, my name is JP Dixon (you may have already read the website title). I am a student of Computer Engineering from Mexico.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am currently working on a trilogy of novels called <a href="/books/#DreamOfKings">A Dream of Kings</a>, which I will be posting more about that on the <a href="/books">books</a> page. You can also go over to <a href="/maps/">maps</a> to find some of the maps I have created for this book series (though not all of the maps you'll find there are part of the novels).
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to learn other languages and learn about the history of other cultures and countries. I speak Spanish natively and English is my second language, but I have also studied Italian, Russian and I will be going to Sweden next semester, so I have already started learning a bit. I also really like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaWExiNMp2A" target="_blank">conlangs</a> and I am currently working on my own conlang for the world of The Dream of Kings called <a href="#">Thedra</a>. I will try to post some stuff about that on here when I have the time.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am also a fan of music. I play the guitar and sing (not great), and I used to play in a short-lived band called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO90wXYXuwA" target="blank">Space Animals</a> (stick around and I might tell you about that too!). Some of my favorit artists include Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, Nirvana, Pink Floyd, Steely Dan, among others.
					</p>
