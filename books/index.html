			<h4>Introduction:</h4>
			<p>
				<em>A Dream of Kings</em> is a trilogy which follows Jack Bell and his friends, Susan and Mark on their adventures and in their fight to defeat the evil Emperor Brax-Vas.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the world of <em>A Dream of Kings</em> there exist four dimensions: Gaiarra (Earth), Kashmiralo, Ficcius and Kadatran. The four dimensions are home to many magical creatures like Dragons, Giants, Werewolves and Warlocks, as well as to the five <em>Gentle Races:</em> Men, Elves, Dwarves, Lamia and Rumanir.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Kadatran, home to the Vrotonians, a new power has risen from the desert, the Braxian Empire threatens the Vrotonian Kingdom with invasion. Jack Bell must travel across the dimensions to find ancient weapons and lost artifacts to deter this threat and finally defeat Brax-Vas and his army of dark assassins, spies and Warlocks.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first book in the trilogy follows Jack Bell a 16 year old boy who discovers that the world is threatened by the Evil Emperor <em>Brax-Vas</em>. The gates which once connected the four dimensions: <em>Gaiarra, Kashmiralo, Ficcius and Kadatran</em> have been closed mysteriously. It is up to Jack Bell and his friends to travel across the dimensions and find the keys and open the Gates to finally reach Brax-Vas and fight him.
			</p>
