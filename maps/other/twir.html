			<h1>The West is Red: North America</h1>
			<br>
			<h4>The continent of North America as it was in the year 2040 A.D.</h4>
			<p>

				"It has become clear to the Nations of the World, that the American System, built upon the backs of the Black Slave and on the corpses of the Colonized Peoples, has lost all credibility it had left. While the White house in Washington wages another Imperialist War upon the Liberated Mexican People, the Common American has neither Bread nor Water; the Common American sits jobless on the street begging for pennies. It would appear that Washington's pockets are deep for the War Machine, but has only crumbs for its people. <br>
				"Two weeks ago, the gungry people in Williams (Jackson), Mississippi, led by the Black Panther's Party, excercised their right to National Self-Determination by declaring the People's Republic of New Afrika. The United States of America have refused to accept this fact, rather they have mobilized their armies and slaughtered the people they preted to protect. <br>
				"We hereby demand that the United States of America and her allies pull their troops from UMSS and PRNA. Failing to do so, will leave us with only one choice." <br><br>
				~Message to the Nations of the World by Alexey Ivanovich Zakharov, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, February 5th, 2036.
